UFOs

Overview
The project was to expand the website that has been created before by adding additional filter criteria. This would allow the user to search for data based on its state, city, country, and shape.

Results
Once the html has been adjusted, we were askd for additional filter criteria. An user may type the the additonal information to any of the search bars (City, Country, State, and Shape) to search for a particular information about certain area. 

Summary
Users are able to search for there desired information with filtered criteria but the information provided is restricted from January 1st 2010 to January 13 2010. Any date after the 13th will result in a blan page appearing. I would recomend make making the data for the website be constantly updated to show the newest sightings and a "County" or "Town" filter to be added to further understand where the information had came from.
